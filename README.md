### VIM / NeoVim 
requires vim compiled with python support ( vim-nox )
neovim [setted up with python support](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi/wiki/Setting-up-Python-for-Neovim/)

nvim/init.vim should be linked with ~/.config/nvim/init.vim


nVim using [ncm2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2) for autocompletion, 



you should probably check [LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) with [corresponding language server](https://langserver.org/#implementations-server)
There is an [awesome tutorial](https://jacky.wtf/weblog/language-client-and-neovim/) for doing that.

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is required for php-completion support

js completion using [ternjs](https://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#configuration), so check it;
